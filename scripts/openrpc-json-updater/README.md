# OpenRPC Diff & Merge CLI

A command-line tool for comparing and merging OpenRPC JSON specifications.

## GitHub Actions Integration

This tool is used with the `openrpc-updater.yml` workflow that automatically:
- Fetches the latest OpenRPC spec from the ethereum/execution-apis repository
- Compares it with our local version
- Creates a PR with the changes if differences are found

## Exclusions and Customizations (config.js)

This tool applies several filters when processing OpenRPC specifications to align them with our implementation requirements:

### Skipped Methods

**Discarded Methods:**
- `engine_*` - Engine API methods are not supported in our implementation

**Not Implemented Methods:**
- `debug_getBadBlocks`
- `debug_getRawBlock` 
- `debug_getRawHeader`
- `debug_getRawReceipts`
- `debug_getRawTransaction`

These debug methods are excluded because they are not implemented in our current system.

### Skipped Fields/Keys

The following fields are excluded from all methods:
- `examples` - Example values are omitted to reduce specification size
- `baseFeePerBlobGas` - Blob-related fields not applicable to our current implementation
- `blobGasUsedRatio` - Blob-related fields not applicable to our current implementation

### Custom Field Overrides

Certain fields are customized with our own descriptions and metadata for better integration with our system. This includes custom summaries, descriptions, and schema titles for various `eth_*` methods like `eth_feeHistory`, `eth_gasPrice`, `eth_getBalance`, etc.

These customizations ensure the OpenRPC specification aligns with our implementation's specific requirements and documentation standards.
